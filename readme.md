# functional programming

In this repository, I will be working on an assignment part of the tech track at CMD. This assignment will 
be going into cleaning up data sets, working with d3 and eventually creating data visualisations.

### about the project

This project will consists of cleaning "dirty" datasets and making them usable for research and in the end a data visualisation. The dataset I will be using consists of student answers from a survey.

Research question: What cities are most disability friendly? 
sub question: What percentage of parking spaces is for disabilities?

Data needed:
* what garage has disability parking spaces 
* how many parking spaces do these garages have in total
* where are these garages located

more information about my research questions can be found in [my wiki](https://github.com/SharonV33/functional-programming/wiki/Interesting-insights-in-the-RDW-dataset)
