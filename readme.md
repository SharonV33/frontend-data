# Frontend Data

In this repository, I will be working on an assignment part of the tech track at CMD. This assignment will 
be going into cleaning up data sets, working with d3 and creating data visualisations.

[Live link](https://frontend-three-rouge.vercel.app/)

### about the project

This project will consists of cleaning a dataset and making it usable for a data visualisation. The dataset I will be using consists of
a large amount of parking garages in the Netherlands. The dataset I will be using can be found [here](https://npropendata.rdw.nl/) 

**Research question:** how do provinces compare to each other in the amount of disability friendly parking garages?

**sub question:** is there a pattern to which provinces have the most disability friendly parking garages

Data needed:
* what garage has disability parking spaces 
* In what province are these garages located
